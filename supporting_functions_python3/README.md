### Library of Python 3 supporting functions

This library contains general-purpose functions, mostly for biological
applications.

Contents (by section):
  1. PDB parsing: eventually, it will contain a very general-purpose PDB parser
     collecting all information, even from the header of the PDB file
  2. Error logging: a useful routine to make your logs in an orderly way, record
     them in a log file and print them in stdout if needed
  3. Downloading: functions to download various types of standard bioinfo files
     (and keep track of them)
  4. Format editing: functions to edit files and translate formats
